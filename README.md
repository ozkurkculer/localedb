Localization (L10n) is more than just translation. It's about getting the currency right, the date format perfect, and the number separators exact. **LocaleDB.org** is a community-driven database designed to give developers instant access to structured localization data for every country on Earth.

## 🚀 The Vision
Every web developer has faced the "Does the currency symbol go before or after the number in Germany?" struggle. Our goal is to eliminate the guesswork by providing ready-to-use, structured **JSON data** for internationalization (i18n) workflows.

## 🛠 Features
- **Currency Logic:** Symbols, positions, and separators (e.g., `1.250,00 ₺` vs `$1,250.00`).
- **Date & Time:** Regional short/long formats and first day of the week.
- **Unit Systems:** Metric vs Imperial, temperature scales, and more.
- **Developer-First:** Clean JSON structures for easy integration.
- **Community-Powered:** Open for contributions from locals worldwide.
